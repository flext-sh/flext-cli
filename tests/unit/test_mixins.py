"""FLEXT CLI Mixins - ValidationMixin Tests Removed.

This file previously contained tests for FlextCliMixins.ValidationMixin.

As of Phase 3 Part 3 (Pydantic v2 Modernization):
- ValidationMixin class has been removed from src/flext_cli/mixins.py
- All validation logic has been moved to inline validation in models.py
- This file is kept as an empty placeholder to avoid import errors

All validation is now done using Pydantic v2 patterns directly in model classes.
